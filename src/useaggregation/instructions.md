This challenge combines enums and the for each loop.


You have been provided with a Main, a Receipt and a Receipt List class. 
The Receipt class is complete and holds information about the type of a receipt BUSINESS or PERSONAL (encoded using an enum), a total amount and a place (where the receipt was used).


Your job is to create a receipt list class that has a constructor that takes no arguments and four methods.

- addReceipt which adds a new receipt to the list.
- getAllReceipts which returns all of the receipts in the list
- getBusinessReceipts which returns all receipts of the BUSINESS type
- getPersonalReceipts which returns all receipts of the PERSONAL type

It is up to you to decide how you would like to design the internal representation of the class.
